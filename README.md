The project that we created simulates a Yahtzee game. The first thing that you will see when you run the program is a menu screen which will allow the player to start a game or to exit the application. If the user types 'start' to start the game the user will come across another screen and will ask the user if they want to roll the dice or exit the application. If the user wants to roll the dice, the dice will roll only once and show the dice. It will also display the scoring rules, scoreboard, and categories that the user can choose to score in. The application will ask the user which category they would like to score in and if they enter an invalid category they will be asked to put it in another category. After choosing the category it will prompt the user to see if they are ready to roll the dice, show scoring rules, show the updated scoreboard that will show them their current scoring in each of the categories, and will also ask the user which available category they would like to score in. After the user repeats these steps and all categories are filled the game shows the user the final score and exits the game.
